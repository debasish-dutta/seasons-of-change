# Seasons of Change

>Trees begin to bare their limbs as their many leaves are shed
Chameleons changes color from the tail to the top of their head
Animals go into hibernation before the first cold winter blast
So it is with our lives we must never try to live in the past 
The sun begins to casts its shadows heralding the close of day 
A flock of birds flies south creating great shapes along the way 
Squirrels scurrying and searching about gathering and storing nuts 
If it wasn't for the seasons of change we would all be stuck in ruts
The wind may blow in any direction north, south, east or west 
When the storms of life has passed all have withstood its test 
Everything must change when it's time to step out their range 
Sow and reap, build up, tear down, this is our season of change
